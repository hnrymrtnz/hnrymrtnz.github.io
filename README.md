<h1>My Website</h1>

<p> I managed to create a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and PHP! Hosted by Github Pages using Jekyll. </p>
<p> ⬇️ Check out the information on each page below. ⬇️ </p>

<h3>Home🏠</h2>
<p> The landing page that directly links to the 'About Me' page using a button.</p>

<h3>About Me🙋‍♂️</h2>
<p> The 'About Me' page that gives a brief description of myself along with languages, frameworks, and interests that I have relating to computer science.</p>

<h3>Coursework📖</h2>
<p> The 'Coursework' page that is accessible through the navigation panel which gives a detailed list of the relevant coursework I have taken at my university. </p>

<h3>Projects🔧</h2>
<p> The 'Projects' page, also accessible through the navigation panel, which lists various different projects that I've completed in and out of the classroom. I will be adding onto this page as time goes on and I work on more projects. </p>

<h3>Resume📝</h2>
<p> A simple 'Resume' page which shows my resume in pdf format. I might change the formatting a bit as it is a bit plain, but for now it works. </p>

<h3>Contact📞</h2>
<p> Finally, the 'Contact' page where I built a message interface using PHP that retrieves a name, email, and message from the user and emails it back to me. I also included a side list with important links such as my LinkedIn and Github pages. </p>
