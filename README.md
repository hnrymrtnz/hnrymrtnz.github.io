<h1>My Website</h1>

<p> I managed to create a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and React.js! Hosted by Github Pages using Jekyll. </p>
<p> ⬇️ Check out the information on each page below. ⬇️ </p>

<h3>Home🏠</h2>
<p> Displays my name and profession. </p>

<h3>About Me🙋‍♂️</h2>
<p> The 'About Me' page that gives a brief description of myself along with languages, frameworks, and interests that I have relating to computer science. </p>

<h3>Coursework📖</h2>
<p> The 'Coursework' page which gives a detailed list of the relevant coursework I have taken at my university. </p>

<h3>Projects🔧</h2>
<p> The 'Projects' page which lists various different projects that I've completed in and out of the classroom. I will be adding onto this page as time goes on and I work on more projects. </p>

<h3>Resume📝</h2>
<p> A simple 'Resume' page which shows my resume in pdf format. I might change the formatting a bit as it is a bit plain, but for now it works. </p>

<h3>Contact📞</h2>
<p> Finally, the 'Contact' page where I listed a few contact resouces. I will be adding a contact form in the future. </p>
