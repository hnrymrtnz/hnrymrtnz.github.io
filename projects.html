                <strong> The Great Lunar Expedition for Everyone (GLEE) is an international student mission to send hundreds of miniature spacecraft called LunaSats to the surface of the Moon to conduct scientific and 
                    technological experiments through hands-on participation by students from all across the world, from South Africa to India. 
                    GLEE aims to engage mission contributors, science and engineering mentors and participants, outreach partners, and the public at large.</strong><br>

            <p class="desc"> 
                <strong> Collaborating with multiple classmates under the guidance of Dr. Steven Fitzgerald, we are creating a web
                    application for format encodings that will serve as an informative and useful way for students to learn an essential
                    topic covered in COMP 122 (Computer Architecture and Assembly Language) for future and current classes,
                    using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Bootstrap. </strong><br>

            <p class="desc"> 
                <strong> Being interested in the topic of web scraping, I developed a program that will tell the user what the #1 Billboard
                    200 album was for their given birthday using year, month, and day input. Made with Apache Maven and Jsoup,
                    the program returns the album name, artist name, and the number of weeks spent at #1, all scraped from
                    Billboardâ€™s website.
